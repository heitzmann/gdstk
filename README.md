Gdstk (GDSII Tool Kit) is a C++ library for creation and manipulation of GDSII and OASIS files.
It is also available as a Python module meant to be a successor to [Gdspy](https://github.com/heitzmann/gdspy).

Key features for the creation of complex CAD layouts are included:

* Boolean operations on polygons (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) based on clipping algorithm
* Polygon offset (inward and outward rescaling of polygons)
* Efficient point-in-polygon solutions for large array sets

Typical applications of Gdstk are in the fields of electronic chip design, planar lightwave circuit design, and mechanical engineering.


## Documentation

The complete documentation is available [here](http://heitzmann.github.io/gdstk).

The source files can be found in the _docs_ directory.


## Installation

### C++ library only

The C++ library is meant to be used by including it in your own source code.

If you prefer to install a static library, the included _CMakeLists.txt_ should be a good starting option (use `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path` to control the installation path):

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --target install
```

The library depends on LAPACK and [zlib](https://zlib.net/).

### Python wrapper

The Python module can be installed via Conda (recommended) or compiled directly from source.
It depends on:

* LAPACK
* [zlib](https://zlib.net/)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) and [rtd theme](https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/) (to build the [documentation](http://heitzmann.github.io/gdstk))

#### Conda

Windows users are suggested to install via [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/) using the available [conda-forge recipe](https://github.com/conda-forge/gdstk-feedstock).
The recipe works on MacOS and Linux as well.

#### From source

The module must be linked aginst LAPACK and zlib.
The included CMakeLists.txt file can be used as a guide.

Installation from source should follow the usual method (there is no need to compile the static library beforehand):

```sh
python setup.py install
```

## Benchmarks

The _benchmarks_ directory contains a few tests to compare the performance gain of the Python interface versus Gdspy.
They are only for reference; the real improvement is heavily dependent on the type of layout and features used.
If maximal performance is important, the library should be used directly from C++, without the Python interface.

Timing results were obtained with Python 3.9 on an Intel Core i7-3930K with 6 cores and 16 GB of RAM at 3.2 GHz.
They represent the best average time to run each function out of 16 sets of 8 runs each.
